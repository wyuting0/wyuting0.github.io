**Welp, here we go again...**

I’ve spent far too much time tinkering with my website. For two years, I’ve overhauled this website so often I've lost count at this point. Sometimes I wonder if anyone even notices or if I’m just trying to convince myself that it looks “finished.”

Almost every time, it seems, I end up cringing at the design choices I made in the previous version — and, more often than not, the blog posts as well. It's inevitable at this point that it'll happen again with this iteration and its contents, but hopefully it’ll stay a bit longer this time.

Somewhere along the way, I realised there’s a kind of truth in this:

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.<br>
> — <cite>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry[^1]</cite>

[^1]: The above quote is excerpted from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s [Airman's Odyssey](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19905-perfection-is-achieved-not-when-there-is-nothing-more-to).

That’s the idea behind this version of my website. With any luck, its simplicity will keep me from feeling the need to redesign it again… at least for a while.
